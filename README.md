# Guitar-Shop Project Submission

This is my completed Next.js project for the **guitar-shop** task.

## Project Overview

This is a 3-page guitar shop application built with Next.js and Apollo Client to fetch data from the provided GraphQL API.

- **Page 1 – Guitar Brands:** Displays all guitar brands fetched from the API. Clicking a brand navigates to the models page.
- **Page 2 – Guitar Models:** Shows models of the selected brand with a search bar to filter by name, a type filter, and pagination.
- **Page 3 – Guitar Details:** Displays detailed specs and musicians using the selected guitar with a tabbed interface and paginated musicians list.

### Additional Features
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- Language switcher supporting English, Macedonian (MK), and Albanian (SQ).
- Graceful handling of loading and error states.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rigakorcaa/guitar-shop-task.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

cd guitar-shop-task 

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Run the development server:

npm run dev

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
